# puwindow
Pickup Window 2.0 is an analogue of **Pickup Window 1.9b** by **545 Studios** from 2001 but much better and with open and free source codes.

Build with GCC 3.2 (mingw special 20020817-1) from DEV-CPP 4.9.8.0 (2003).
Pure C and Win32API application, no GMO required
(like msvcrt.dll, .NET Framework, Visual Studio Redistributable and so on).
Tested under Windows 98, Windows XP, Windows 10, so should work anywhere.
